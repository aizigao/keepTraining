# Intent
- Provide a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
- The C++ and Java standard library abstraction that makes it possible to decouple collection classes and algorithms.
- Promote to "full object status" the traversal of a collection.
Polymorphic traversal
